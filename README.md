Airline explorer app using [instantwebtools.net](https://www.instantwebtools.net/fake-rest-api) fake REST APIs showcasing Kotlin, Jetpack Architecture Components & MVVM.

## Design
* I've used the MVVM architecture following the pattern explained in the [todo-mvvm-live-kotlin branch of Google's architecture-samples repo](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/todo-mvvm-live-kotlin).
* I've used the Navigation Architecture Component to navigate between fragments in the app.
* For the splash screen I've used [themed launch screens](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/launch-time#themed). I just thought it would be an overkill for this small demo to have a separate Activity for splash screen which will fake waiting a couple of seconds unnecessarily.
